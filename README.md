# Rent-Management-System
The rent management system service is a new feature in our smart
world where owners can put their properties on rent and all the rent related
information will be recorded into the system which can be visible by the
respective client with proper authorization. The system can manage hundreds
of owners and tenants with proper security. Services offered by the system
include locality service information like electrician, plumber, carpenters, gasdelivery, drinking water supplier, milk supplier and newspaper supplier.
This system improves the service to the tenant and all the local facilities
can be instantly provided to the tenant. Hence, it improves the society service.
In this project we have added the module concepts of tenant, property, owner
and authentication. The python modules itself like pickle and os have been
used for storing and retrieving the data in the data file.
